Newspaper Curation App
===

Project
---

This project consists of various scripts for converting
[born-digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-digital) PDF newspapers, as
well as scanned newspapers, into a one-batch
[bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) which can be ingested into
[ONI](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni) and
[chronam](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/chronam).  See our other
repositories for the legacy suite.  Actually, don't, unless you want a history
lesson.  They're pretty awful:

- [Back-end python tools](https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/pdf-to-chronam)
  - This has been completely deprecated.  YAY!
- [Front-end PHP app](https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/pdf-to-chronam-admin)
  - This still has a few necessary pieces of the project.  BOO!

*Apologies*: this toolsuite was built to meet our needs.  It's very likely some
of our assumptions won't work for everybody, and it's certain that there are
pieces of the suite which need better documentation.

Please refer to the
[wiki](https://github.com/uoregon-libraries/newspaper-curation-app/wiki) for
detailed documentation.
