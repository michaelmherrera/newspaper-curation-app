<p>
  Tasks on your desk are assigned to you and need attention.  If items aren't
  processed by their expiration, they'll be returned to the appropriate pool
  and any work you've done will be lost.

  <p>
    Pending issues are issues which have been uploaded, split into pages, and
    converted to PDF/a format.  They still need manual metadata entered before
    they will be ready to convert to a batch and ingest.
