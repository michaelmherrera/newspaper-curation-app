## These documents

We're always trying to improve the documentation experience, and we're aware
these docs are incomplete and in some cases probably too specific to UO's
setup.  Pull requests are appreciated!

For keyboard users: note that the sidebar is *after* the main content in the
DOM, so if you're trying to tab there, it'll show up toward the end of the
document.  Also note that you can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate
through the articles as they appear in the sidebar.

## Project

This project consists of various scripts for converting
[born-digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-digital) PDF newspapers, as
well as scanned newspapers, into a one-batch
[bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) which can be ingested into
[ONI](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni) and
[chronam](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/chronam).

See the documentation links in the sidebar for semi-organized, sort-of-helpful
kinda-in-depth information.
