## vX.Y.Z

Brief description, if necessary

### Fixed

### Added

### Changed

- The workflow pages should generally look the same as previously, but they no
  longer pre-fetch gobs of data:
  - A maximum of 100 issues is presented on a tab now
  - Issues are loaded for a tab when the tab is selected rather than all tabs'
    issues being loaded at once
  - JSON endpoints for issues now exist which will allow for future fixes and
    improvements to the workflow tabs

### Removed

### Migration
