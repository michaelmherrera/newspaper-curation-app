## vX.Y.Z

Brief description, if necessary

### Fixed

- Audit logs can now be filtered without having to choose a single individual.

### Added

- New filtering options for audit logs to see grouped logs by general type.
- Some basic info/help/background text is now shown after the audit log block
  to hopefully help explain what exactly the purpose is for these logs.

### Changed

- Audit log types are now in a controlled list rather than just any text, which
  should make the audit logs more meaningful as new stuff needs to be audited.

### Removed

### Migration
