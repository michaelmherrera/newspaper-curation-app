## vX.Y.Z

Brief description, if necessary

### Fixed

- Workflow tab selection no longer adds countless entries to your browser history
- Workflow tabs now manipulate the query string of the URL rather than the
  fragment. The main improvement from this is that the "skip to main content"
  link now functions properly in the workflow pages.
- Workflow tabs are now level two headings, which should be an improvement for
  screen-reader users and users of tools which let you browse and navigate to
  headings.
