# Binary paths
###

# What is the path to the ghostscript binary?  Usually you can just leave this
# set to "gs", but may need to be tweaked on some systems.
GHOSTSCRIPT="gs"

# What is the path to the opj binaries?  This may be opj_compress /
# opj_decompress, opj2_*, or a full path, depending on a variety of factors....

# Web configuration
###

# Full URL to the Black Mamba web app; though the hostname isn't currently used,
# it may be necessary for things like sending email notifications in the future
WEBROOT="https://internal.somewhere.edu/black-mamba"

# The bind address is what the server listens on, often just a port string
# prefixed with a colon.  Apache would use this for reverse-proxying.
BIND_ADDRESS=":12345"

# Full URL to the IIIF server's base path - this is used to display issues'
# pages during metadata entry and review
IIIF_BASE_URL="https://my.server.com/iiif"

# Full URL to the live news site, for pulling information about issues which
# are in production, and may be used in the future to link from Black Mamba to
# live batches' / issues' detail pages

# Paths for PDFs, derivatives, etc.
###

# Master PDFs are deposited here - these should be exactly what the publisher
# gives us.  There must be one subdirectory per title, named after the title's
# "SFTP Directory" value in the admin app, and each title must contain one
# subdirectory per issue, named by the issue's date, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
MASTER_PDF_UPLOAD_PATH="/mnt/news/sftp"

# In-house scans are deposited here.  The folder structure must be precisely as follows:
#
#     <scan upload root>/<MARC org code>/<lccn>/<issue date with optional edition>
#
# For example, "/mnt/news/scans/oru/sn12345678/2018-01-01_02"
#
# The TIFF files should be at least 300dpi, and the PDFs should contain a
# 150dpi JPEG image encoded at about a quality of 40 (or "medium"), per the
# NDNP spec.  The PDF also needs to have the OCR text embedded for the
# derivative processing to create the proper page XML.
MASTER_SCAN_UPLOAD_PATH="/mnt/news/scans"

# When a master PDF has been split, this is where we back it up.  Master files
# are stored in the batches, so if you back up the batch, this can be a short-
# term backup location.
MASTER_PDF_BACKUP_PATH="/mnt/news/backup/master"

# This is where split PDFs are moved for manual reordering / renaming (e.g.,
# using Adobe Bridge)
PDF_PAGE_REVIEW_PATH="/mnt/news/page-review"

# Once processing happens, batches are put here
BATCH_OUTPUT_PATH="/mnt/news/outgoing"

# This is where scanned issues and SFTPed issues go after all manual processing
# is done.  Issues moved here shouldn't be accessible to anybody for manual
# modification, and all metadata will live in the database.
WORKFLOW_PATH="/mnt/news/workflow"

# This is where cached files are stored for the issue data.  This is extremely
# important for issues which live on the live website, as those are very
# expensive to pull each time a given process is run.
ISSUE_CACHE_PATH="/var/local/news/black-mamba/cache"

# This is where the core application lives, and is important for finding the
# HTML template files as well as static files like JS and CSS
APP_ROOT="/usr/local/black-mamba"

# Where are the XML templates for building issue XML?  You can point this to
# the XML in the repo (templates/xml) for ease, but some XML values may be wrong.
XML_TEMPLATE_PATH="/usr/local/black-mamba/templates/xml"

###
# General rules for issue processing and batch creation
###

# How many pages must an issue have?  Setting this to 2 can avoid processing
# obviously unfinished uploads.
MINIMUM_ISSUE_PAGES=2

# MARC organization code you want to use in chronam to represent batches from
# PDF sources.  e.g., "oru" results in batch names like
# "batch_oru_20150101120000", attributed to the UO Knight Library.  It is best
# to choose a code that chronam already knows about.
PDF_BATCH_MARC_ORG_CODE="oru"

# How many PDFs do we allow in a single batch?
#
# NOTE: If there are more than this in the PDF source path, you'll have to run
# the process multiple times, but you will ensure smaller batches
#
# NOTE: this limit will *not* split an issue.  i.e., this is the maximum number
# of PDFs, not necessarily the precise number a batch will contain.
MAX_BATCH_SIZE=1200

# What is the minimum size of a batch?  Issues will not be batched until there
# are at least this many pages.  Use this setting with care!  If it's set too
# high, issues could sit around indefinitely waiting to be batched, especially
# if you get PDFs infrequently and/or have a lot of small scanned batches with
# various MARC Org Codes.
MIN_BATCH_SIZE=200

# How many days does an issue have to wait after its publish date if it's
# listed as an embargoed publication?
EMBARGO_DAYS=92

###
# Derivative settings
###

# DPI for ghostscript to use on the PDF-to-PNG conversion
DPI=200

# JP2 quality value for graphicsmagick
QUALITY=62.5

# Set this to the value your scanned images use to embed JPGs.  This should be
# 150 per the NDNP spec, but could be changed if scanned images aren't under
# your control.
SCANNED_PDF_DPI=150
